# Machine Learning Explainability
 Machine Learning methods have proven to be effective in accomplishing certain tasks dealing with large databases. However, the way these methods make predictions is often not understood and might be biased by the data present in specific datasets. 
 ## Study Overview
 In this study two distinct databases were used to train Random Forest and Support Vector Classifiers. The performance of these methods was recorded using AUC Score - method widely used in industry, and compared. Then most important features for each ML model were identified and compared.
 ## Results
 The study showed that in a Machine Learning model not all the data features are relevant for determining correct predictions. For this project 1/2 of most important features were selected and new models were trained using only these features. The study showed that the new models had an accuracy close to the accuracy of models with full-feature datasets.
